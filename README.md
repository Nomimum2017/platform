This repository contains Rune.io Platform Software and it includes a
fetched copy of OpenWRT (locked to particular commit tag).

Rune.io Platform software brings in generic software as well as platform
dependent changes. The build script pulls these into the correct OpenWRT
tree locations, and fires off the build.
