There are multiple methods to flash GL-AR150 with desired firmware.

The steps must be carefully undertaken, to avoid bricking the Router.


Firmware Requirements:
======================

1.  The firmware to be flashed must be a one built by OpenWRT,  must have the Root-FileSystem packed as SquashFS in the overall firmware image, and be of type sysupgrade.

Typical filenames are:  openwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl_ar150-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin

In future we will overload the filename to hid the epoch string, to make image manipulations easier.
So the filenames will become something of the sorts:  openwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl_ar150-squashfs-sysupgrade-epoch-3280094361.bin

2.  Firmware must a one built for ar71xx CPU, and gl-ar150 subtarget


Obtaining Firmware:
===================

Firmware may be obtained from either of:

1.  Already available on S3.
  e.g. aws s3 cp  s3://rune-alpha-firmware/121ABC456DEF/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl_ar150-squashfs-sysupgrade.146245455259.bin

2.  If firmware is gzip compressed, it must be un'gzip'ed prior to use.

3.  Firmware has embedded AWS IOT certificates and THing Name.  These must be manipulated prior to flashing, and matched with Device Serial-# or Mac-Addresses.   (A tool exists in git repository to modify the embedded info)

4.  Obtain from Developer.  Irfan can provide a ready firmware image, but it may not be customized provisioned as per #3.


Modifying Firmware:
===================

As mentioned firmware has to be modified, so that the embedded AWS-IOT certificates and THing Name matches the Rune Provisioning Database.

In early days development, it may not be such a big issue. But anytime a configuration parameter changes, it will end up modifying operation of multiple devices.

A tool exists in git repository to modify the embedded info.



Flashing Firmware:
==================

Firmware can be flashed as follows:

1.  Device's WAN port must be activiated.  i.e. connected to a DHCP server via WAN port, which will provide it a temporary address lease.
2.  Device's LAN port must be connected to a local PC/laptop directly or via a Switch.
3.  Web Management access is only provided on the LAN port network.
4.  Configure the local PC/laptop to an address in 192.168.8.x  network.
5.  Ping and verify connectivity to 192.168.8.1
6.  Open Web browser on PC/laptop and navigate to 192.168.8.1 address.
7.  Further navigate to System->Utilities->Firmware Upgrade  and follow instructions to upload the firmware and then click OK to upgrade.
8.  After upgrade the Router will reboot into new firmware.
9.  During flashing / upgrade process, the Router should not suffer any disconnections or Power interruptions.




Updated 05/09/2016:  Alternate flashing method:

Another shortcut exists, in case the local PC/laptop has a telnet client available.

With the same prior topology, 'telnet' to 192.168.8.1.
You will be connected to the Router in 'Root' priviliged mode.
At Router prompt (which is totally Linux shell),  'scp' over the  firmware file from the PC/laptop.
scp  user@192.168.1.x:/firmware-path/firmware-file /tmp
Verify md5 of the transferred file, with the md5 on the PC/laptop.  ** very important **
Initiate firmwar Flash by issuing:
' mtd -r write /tmp/firmware-file firware'
This will start firmware direct copy on to flash sub-partition.
At the end of flashing (may take 1-3 minutes), the Router will self-reboot to new firmware image.
